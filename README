# Minimal Webserver in Assembly (x86-64)
This project is a learning exercise to understand how webservers work
The source and inspiration come from:
- https://pwn.college/ 
- https://youtu.be/MpsDNv-I8i0?si=UBZxxZSMCHWHr5c8

Tools I use:
- gcc as a compiler and a linker 

compiler: transforms x86-64 assembly (".s" files) into machine code (".o" object files)  
linker: transforms ".o" files into an ELF binary (Executable and Linkable Format), which can be run by the Linux kernel 

What is a webserver? 
A webserver is a Software for servers to process HTTP(S) requests.
